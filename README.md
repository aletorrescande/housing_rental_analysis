# housing_rental_analysis
The San Francisco Housing jupyter Notebook includes an analysis of housing units, sale price per square foot and gross rent between 2010 and 2016. By reading, cleaning and grouping the sample data I was able to create visualizations to better illustrate the results of the analysis. The mean values were used between groups to better analyze the data.

The questions answered in this analysis include: 
- The trend in housing units, sale price psf and gross rent between 2010 and 2016 and between neighborhoods.
- Lowest rent shown for the evaluated time period.
- Neighborhood with highest sales price psf and gross rent.
- Insight on one click, buy-and-rent strategy.

The libraries and dependencies used include:
1) Pandas
2) Hvplot
3) Pathlib 
4) Panel
